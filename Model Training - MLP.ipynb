    "**1) dropout vs hidden neurons (@ epochs = 30)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that with increased learning capacity (hidden neurons = 500), increasing dropout rate actually reduces the validation loss. However, with lower learning capacity (hidden neurons = 150,300), increasing dropout actually harms the performance of the model by increasing the validation loss. This is expected, because with increasingly complex models, it is more likely to overfit, hence dropouts serve as regularisation parameters, which improves the model's ability to generalise. We also observe that for higher dropout rates (0.25,0.5), performance improves with increasing hidden neurons. If we try to apply more regularisation to models with lower learning capacity, we will observe higher bias and poorer performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Epochs vs hidden neurons (@ dropout = 0.1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe that with more hidden neurons, performance is better with less training epochs. The lowest validation loss is at 100 epochs for a model with 150 hidden neurons, whereas the lowest validation loss is at 30 epochs for a model with 300 & 500 hidden neurons. With more neurons, we increase the complexity & expressiveness of the model, hence resulting in faster convergence. Any further training resulted in worsening performance (increased validation losses). Furthermore, due to the low dropout rate for this case, it is easy for the model to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Epochs vs dropout (@ hidden neurons = 500)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that for low dropout rates, we quickly converge and any further training hurts the performance. At increasing dropout rates, performance improved with more epochs, as more iterations are required for the model to converge. For a more complex model, regardless at any epoch counts, we observe that performance improves with increased dropout."
