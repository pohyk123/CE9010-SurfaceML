# CE9010-SurfaceML
Help robots recognize the floor surface theyâ€™re standing on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors).

## Project Description
IMU sensor data was collected while driving a small mobile robot over different floor surfaces on the university premises. The task is to predict which one of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete) the robot is on using sensor data such as acceleration and velocity. See [Kaggle] for more details.
